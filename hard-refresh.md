**Performing a Hard-Refresh**
This lab requires a browser function called a hard-refresh to force the browser to refresh all the elements on the page.
A refresh of the browser does not force a download of elements cached locally to the browser.
There are many keyboard and keyboard+cursor methods to refresh and hard-refresh a browser. 
Specifically in this lab, the following commands will work correctly:
- Clicking the browser refresh icon &#x21BB; located in the task bar performs a refresh.
- Holding down the **Shift** key and clicking browser refresh icon &#x21BB; will perform a hard-refresh.
- Pressing the **F5** (function(fn) and 5 keys / fn+5 keys) will perform a refresh.
- Pressing **Shift+F5** (Shift+fn+5) will perform a hard-refresh.

>[!alert] Using familar keyboard browser refresh commands will cause the browser window displaying the lab environment to refresh.  Remember, refresh and hard-refresh commands require different keyboard commands to issue the browser hard-refresh to the browser on the Student Workstation *inside* the lab environment.
